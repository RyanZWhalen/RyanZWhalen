# Ryan's Landing Page

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Whalen, an **Applied Mathematics** (Econ/CS specialization) and **Statistics** double-concentrator at **Harvard University**. 

Even though I surround myself now with tons of programming, finance, and mathematics-based involvements, I was a hard-core social sciences/humanities person in another life. 

So, it's been my personal journey to explore the intersections and find the gems the lie between the two worlds! Would love to chat with anyone about any of these topics!

I'm currently involved in various **clubs/fellowships** on campus, including (but not limited to):

_- Harvard University Capital Partners ðŸ’¡
- Scholars of Finance ðŸ“ˆ
- Tech 4 Social Good ðŸŒŽ
- Harvard University Machine Intelligence Community ðŸ¤–
- The Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal ðŸ”¬_

**Organiations & Projects** that I'm currently working at and on/previously have worked at and on:

_- University Research - built basic stock-market forecaster using random forests and decision trees (Stanford), secure AI platform for patient diagnostics/robust voice-activated healthcare assistant (Columbia), and currently working on large-scale cultural data collection and discovering multi-modal infrastructure for early-stage cancer detection through cell-slicing (Harvard).
- Orient Securities - built an automated productivity ecosystem, replicating tools such as Slack, Notion, and Monday.com, for trading/risk-management team.
- RevRoad Ventures - worked on automating startup sourcing and outreach using basic VBA scripts, Excel algorithms (JavaScript), and Gmail extensions (Python)._

My personal hobbies outside of academics/extracurriculars include: basketball, house/alternative music, and Chiikawa! :3
