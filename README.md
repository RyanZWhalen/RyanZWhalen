# Ryan's Landing Page

Hello there! 👋

My name is Ryan Whalen, an **Applied Mathematics** (Econ/CS specialization) and **Statistics** double-concentrator at **Harvard University**. 

Even though I surround myself now with tons of programming, finance, and mathematics-based involvements, I was a hard-core social sciences/humanities person in another life. 

So, it's been my personal journey to explore the intersections and find the gems the lie between the two worlds! Would love to chat with anyone about any of these topics!

I'm currently involved in various **clubs/fellowships** on campus, including (but not limited to):

- [_Harvard University Capital Partners 💡_](https://www.harvardcap.org/)
- [_Scholars of Finance 📈_](https://scholarsoffinance.org/)
- [_Tech 4 Social Good 🌎_](https://socialgood.hcs.harvard.edu/)
- _Harvard University Machine Intelligence Community 🤖_
- _The Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal 🔬_

**Organiations & Projects** that I'm currently working at and on/previously have worked at and on:

- _University Research_ - built basic stock-market forecaster using random forests and decision trees (Stanford), secure AI platform for patient diagnostics/robust voice-activated healthcare assistant (Columbia), and currently working on large-scale cultural data collection and discovering multi-modal infrastructure for early-stage cancer detection through cell-slicing (Harvard).
- _Orient Securities_ - built an automated productivity ecosystem, replicating tools such as Slack, Notion, and Monday.com, for trading/risk-management team.
- _RevRoad Ventures_ - worked on automating startup sourcing and outreach using basic VBA scripts, Excel algorithms (JavaScript), and Gmail extensions (Python).
- _Project Destined_ - worked with a team of real-estate valuation interns to price/pitch property in Newton, MA (won "Best Pitch" out of 90 teams).

My personal hobbies outside of academics/extracurriculars include: basketball, house/alternative music, and Chiikawa! :3
