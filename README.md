Hello!

My name is Ryan Whalen, an Applied Mathematics (Econ/CS specialization) and Statistics double-concentrator at Harvard University. 

I'm interested in all-things programming, finance, and mathematics! I'm currently involved in various organizations on campus, including (but not limited to):

Harvard University Capital Partners, Scholars of Finance, Tech 4 Social Good, Harvard University Machine Intelligence Community, and The Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal

I'm currently working on FinanTerm, a highly-accessible, UI/UX-friendly native terminal to enables users to read and visualize financial data derived directly from articles (Bloomberg, Barron's, Yahoo Finance)
